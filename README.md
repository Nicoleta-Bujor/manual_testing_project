<h1> Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course </h1>

The final project for the IT Factory Manual Testing course aims to demonstrate the application of acquired knowledge and skills in a real-world scenario. It involves the use of a live application to showcase testing techniques and methodologies.

Application under test: [XYZ Bank](https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/#/login)

For this project, the XYZ Bank application will serve as the application under test. As the original documentation is unavailable, I have prepared my own documentation to identify bugs and perform static testing.

API Documentation: [Simple Book API Documentation](https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course/blob/main/simple-books-api.md)

Documentation: [Documentation for XYZ Bank](https://github.com/Nicoleta-Bujor/manual_testing_project/blob/main/Documentatie%20pt%20xyz%20bank.docx)

The final project will be divided into two main sections: Testing Section and SQL Section. Within the Testing Section, there will be two subsections: GUI Testing and API Testing using the Postman tool.

Tools Used: Jira, Zephyr Squad, Postman, SQL Workbench, Github.

# Functional specifications

The XYZ Bank application is designed to cater to both customers and bank managers. It allows customers to check their account details, view transaction history, manage credit balance, and perform deposit and withdrawal transactions.

# 1 Testing section

## 1.1 Test Planning

The Test Planning phase encompasses detailed testing information for the XYZ Bank application. It includes:

•	Identification of items and features to be tested

•	Types of testing to be performed

•	Definition of entry and exit criteria

•	Assignment of roles and responsibilities

•	Allocation of time and financial resources

•	Identification and assessment of risks

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.

### 1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated

•	Scrum manager - Ioana Ionescu

•	Software Tester - Marin Sorescu

•	Review leader - Andrei Preutescu

•	Software architect - Nicoleta Bujor

•	Developer - Bianca Rusu

### 1.1.2 Entry criteria defined

•	Roles and human resources allocated

•	System is up and running

•	User accounts are created

### 1.1.3 Exit criteria defined

•	All test cases are executed

•	At least 70% of executed test cases have a "Passed" status

•	Maximum of 3 high-rated bugs remain open and assigned to developers for resolution

•	Maximum of 10 open bugs, with no critical bugs remaining

•	Regression testing is completed

•	Testing deadline: 15.07.2023

### 1.1.4 Test scope

Tests in scope: Review and functional testing (black box), GUI testing, API testing, regression testing Out of Scope.

Tests not in scope: Non-functional testing (performance, stress, volume, compatibility, and mobile testing), White-box Testing Techniques for Functional Testing.

### 1.1.5 Risks detected

Project risks: Developer unavailability, vacant positions, lack of resources, non-functional environment, illness, limited experienced personnel.

Product risks: Operational risk, validation risk, price risks, poor usability, and application quality.

### 1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

The entry criteria defined in the Test Planning phase have been fulfilled, and the testing process continues.

## 1.2 Test Monitoring and Control

Periodic reports are generated to provide an overview of the current test status. Jira and Zephyr tools are utilized for tracking and management purposes.

## 1.3 Test Analysis

Requirements for UI testing and API testing were reviewed based on the provided documentation. Defects were identified and documented. After fixing the defects, updated documentation was released.

•	Login functionality

•	Bank manager's ability to add a customer

•	Bank manager's ability to open an account

•	Verification of new customer addition to the customer list

•	Bank manager's ability to delete a customer

•	Customer's login functionality

•	Customer's transaction history

•	Customer's ability to view transactions within a specified period

•	Customer's ability to make deposits and withdrawals

## 1.4 Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are:

Test cases: -> enter here test cases or at least the titles

The test cases with steps can be viewed here: test_cases.pdf

## 1.5 Test Implementation

The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:

## 1.6 Test Execution

Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: cycle_summary_execution.pdf

Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: created_bugs.pdf

enter here bug titles

## 1.7 Test Completion

Exit criteria was evaluated and passed

The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: Traceability_matrix.csv

Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows.... -> describe the final report
